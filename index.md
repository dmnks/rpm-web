## RPM Package Manager

The RPM Package Manager (RPM) is a powerful package management system
capable of

* building computer software from source into easily distributable
  packages
* installing, updating and uninstalling packaged software
* querying detailed information about the packaged software, whether
  installed or not
* verifying integrity of packaged software and resulting software installation
