## Changes
### Enhancements
* Support for [declarative buildsystems](https://rpm-software-management.github.io/rpm/manual/buildsystem.html) ([#1087](https://github.com/rpm-software-management/rpm/issues/1087))
* A per-package build directory that's fully RPM-controlled is now used and exposed as the new `%builddir` macro at build time ([#2078](https://github.com/rpm-software-management/rpm/issues/2078))
* Support for [SPEC-local](https://rpm-software-management.github.io/rpm/manual/dependency_generators.html#using-file-attributes-in-their-own-package) file attributes and generators ([#782](https://github.com/rpm-software-management/rpm/issues/782))
* New `--list` and `--delete` commands to `rpmkeys(8)`
* New `--json` query format, as a more readable alternative to `--xml`
* A new `-C` option in `%autosetup` which ensures that the sources will be extracted in the root of the build directory ([#2664](https://github.com/rpm-software-management/rpm/issues/2664))
* A new low-level package dump utility, installed as `/usr/lib/rpm/rpmdump`
* Build scriptlets (such as `%build`, `%install` or `%check`) can now be [augmented](https://rpm-software-management.github.io/rpm/manual/spec.html#build-scriptlets) arbitrary number of times by appending or prepending to them with the new `-a` and `-p` options
* The `rpm2archive(8)` utility now supports cpio file format, replacing the implementation of `rpm2cpio(8)` which is now installed as a symlink to the former
* File trigger scripts now receive package count arguments, much like regular triggers ([#2755](https://github.com/rpm-software-management/rpm/issues/2755))
* Group membership lines are now supported in `sysusers.d(5)` files
* Comments (starting with a `#`) are now allowed after SPEC conditionals
* Indentation is now [allowed](https://rpm-software-management.github.io/rpm/manual/spec.html#preamble-tags) for SPEC tags ([#2927](https://github.com/rpm-software-management/rpm/issues/2927))
* Distributions can now override build conditionals (`%bcond`) system-wide with the new `%{bcond_override_default NAME VALUE}` macro
* The build time is now exposed to build scriptlets via the new `$RPM_BUILD_TIME` environment variable
* The `${XDG_CONFIG_HOME}/rpm` directory is now the preferred location when loading per-user macro configuration ([#2153](https://github.com/rpm-software-management/rpm/issues/2153))
* A new [multi-file protocol](https://rpm-software-management.github.io/rpm/manual/dependency_generators.html#writing-dependency-generators) allowing for much faster dependency generation
* The Python bindings have been ported to the stable Python ABI ([#2345](https://github.com/rpm-software-management/rpm/issues/2345))
* RPM can now be built without OpenPGP support, allowing for easier bootstrapping (see the INSTALL file for details)
* A new plugin `rpm-plugin-unshare(8)` that allows for using various Linux-specific namespace-related technologies inside transactions, such as to harden and limit scriptlet access to resources ([#2632](https://github.com/rpm-software-management/rpm/issues/2632), [#2665](https://github.com/rpm-software-management/rpm/issues/2665))
* The plugin API is now public ([#1536](https://github.com/rpm-software-management/rpm/issues/1536))
* The OpenSSL code has been moved to newer API ([#2723](https://github.com/rpm-software-management/rpm/issues/2294))

### Changes
* The deprecated internal OpenPGP parser has now been removed ([#2414](https://github.com/rpm-software-management/rpm/issues/2414))
* The Perl dependency generators have been split out of the main repository ([#2873](https://github.com/rpm-software-management/rpm/issues/2873))
* `brp-strip` no longer strips Ruby, Python and Javascript files

### Fixes
* `rpm2archive(8)` now writes compliant cpio archives again ([#2974](https://github.com/rpm-software-management/rpm/issues/2974))
* Ignore `%config` usage with unsupported file entries (i.e. with anything else than regular files or links) instead of failing the build ([#2890](https://github.com/rpm-software-management/rpm/issues/2890))
* Ignore non-scriptlet weak dependencies in ordering ([#1346](https://github.com/rpm-software-management/rpm/issues/1346))
* Ensure binary and source headers are identified as such after parse (Regression) ([#2819](https://github.com/rpm-software-management/rpm/issues/2819))
* Never use current user info or file ownership during build (Regression) ([#2604](https://github.com/rpm-software-management/rpm/issues/2604))
* Ensure rpmbuild's cleanup doesn't fail due to permissions ([#2519](https://github.com/rpm-software-management/rpm/issues/2519))
* Let eBPF ELF files be packaged in noarch packages ([#2875](https://github.com/rpm-software-management/rpm/issues/2875))
* Really allow qualifiers like pre/post/meta for weak dependencies ([#624](https://github.com/rpm-software-management/rpm/issues/624))
* Set git commit dates in `%autosetup -S git` based on `$SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH` ([#9](https://pagure.io/fedora-reproducible-builds/project/issue/9))
* Issue a warning when passing arguments to non-parametric macros ([#2932](https://github.com/rpm-software-management/rpm/issues/2932))
* Make `%dirname` and `%basename` behave like `dirname(3)` and `basename(3)` ([#2928](https://github.com/rpm-software-management/rpm/issues/2928))
* Fix dependency generators sometimes dying with `SIGPIPE` (Regression) ([#2949](https://github.com/rpm-software-management/rpm/issues/2949))
* Run build scriptlets with closed stdin to enforce unattended builds

## Compatibility notes
* The `%patchN` macro syntax (where `N` is a patch number) is now obsolete and
  will produce a build error.  Use `%patch N` (or `%patch -P N`) instead.
* Comments after SPEC conditionals are now valid syntax (and won't cause a
  warning), any other text that doesn't start with a `#` is now an error.
* Python 3.7 and OpenSSL 3.0 (when enabled) are now the minimum build
  requirements.
