# RPM 6.0.0 ALPHA Release Notes (DRAFT)

### Download
* Source:
* SHA256SUM:

Changes since RPM 4.20.1:

### General
* RPM defaults to enforcing signature checking (#1573)
* RPM uses the full key ID or fingerprint to identify OpenPGP keys everywhere
  (#2403, ...)
* Support for multiple OpenPGP signatures per package (#3385)
* Support for both RPM v4 and v6 packages
* Support for installing RPM v3 packages has been removed (#1107)
* By default, RPM no longer verifies obsolete crypto (MD5, SHA1, DSA) (#1292)
* Many documentation updates

### User Interface
* `rpmkeys --import` can now be used to update keys. This also
  updates the key handle from a short ambiguous key id to full fingerprint.
* `rpmkeys --export` added for exporting keys
* `rpmkeys --checksig`, `--list`, `--delete` use and expect full
  fingerprint of the keys (#3360)
* `rpmsign` can use either GnuPG or Sequoia-sq for signing (controlled
  by `%_openpgp_sign` macro (`gpg` or `sq`)
* `rpmsign --addsign` always adds a new signature (arbitrary number of
  signatures supported now)
* `rpmsign --resign` replaces all existing signatures with a new one
* `--pkgid` and `--hdrid` query sources cli-switches have been dropped
  (#2633)
* New query tag extensions (eg with `--qf <format>`):
  * `rpmformat` for determining package format version (3/4/6)
  * `openpgp` for managing all supported OpenPGP signature types
* New `--filemime` query alias for querying per-file MIME info
* Consistent terminology and case usage in signature and key messages
  * OpenPGP signatures are called OpenPGP in output
  * RPM v3 header+payload signatures are called "legacy" in output

### Spec & Package Building

* `rpmbuild` now supports generating two different package formats
  (controlled by `%_rpmformat` macro):
  * [RPM v6](https://rpm-software-management.github.io/rpm/manual/format_v6.html)
    * All file sizes and related limits are 64bit
    * Crypto modernization
    * MIME file info
    * Widely compatible with rpm >= 4.14
  * [RPM v4](https://rpm-software-management.github.io/rpm/manual/format_v4.html)
    * Bit-per-bit compatible with packages produced by rpm 4.x
* `rpmbuild` can now automatically sign packages if `%_openpgp_autosign_id`
  macro is defined (#2678)
* `brp-elfperms` buildroot policy script was removed (#3195)

### Development & Build System

### API Changes
* Several additions to rpmKeyring:
  * rpmKeyringInitIterator(), rpmKeyringIteratorNext(),
    rpmKeyringIteratorFree() for iterating over keyring contents
  * rpmKeyringVerifySig2()
  * rpmKeyringModify() for ... XXX we don't need it anymore in the API?
* Several additions to rpmPubkey:
  * rpmPubkeyFingperint(), rpmPubkeyFingerprintAsHex(),
    rpmPubkeyKeyIDAsHex() and rpmPubkeyArmorWrap() accessors
* rpmtxnDeletePubkey() for deleting pubkey's from transaction keystore

### Internal Improvements
* RPM is now built as C++20 code (except for plugins and Python bindings)
  * All relevant sources have been renamed to `.cc` or `.hh` extension
  * Many dynamic data structures moved to STL and other similar refactorings
* Numerous improvements to the test-suite
  * Simplify test creation
* New openpgp.cert.d based keystore (experimental) (#3341)
* Make reference counting atomic throughout the codebase
* Fix keystore reads lacking transaction lock
* Fix a race condition in rpmioMkpath() (#3508)
* Fix recursion depth for macro error message (#3197)
* Drop gpg(keyid) provides from gpg-pubkey headers (#3360)
* Optimize rpmlog() locking


### Compatibility Notes
#### Package format
* Support for RPM v3 packages has been removed. They can still be queried
  and also unpacked with rpm2cpio.
* RPM v4 packages remain fully supported (but see below for crypto limitations)
* RPM v6 packages
  * Can be queried with rpm >= 4.6
  * Can be unpacked with rpm >= 4.12
  * Can be verified and installed with rpm >= 4.14 (with caveats/limitations)
* In the default configuration, packages built with rpm < 4.14.0 cannot
  be verified due to their use of weak, obsolete MD5 and SHA1 digests.
  For strongly signed packages, this can be worked around by changing
  `%_pkgverify_level` to `signature` so the weak digests are simply ignored.
  If verifying the weak digests is necessary, the rpm 4.x behavior can
  be restored by setting `%_pkgverify_flags` to `0`.

#### Other
* Package signing key configuration differs from the past. To support
  other implementations besides GnuPG, the signer ID is now set via
  `%_openpgp_sign_id` macro, which defaults to `%{?_gpg_name}` for
  backwards compatibility.
* The low-level package signing macros are now parametric, any custom
  `%__gpg_sign_cmd` overrides will simply not work as such. Users are
  encouraged to look into dropping such overrides rather than just
  updating, most such overrides haven't been necessary in a long time.
