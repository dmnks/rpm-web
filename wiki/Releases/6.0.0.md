### Download
* Source:
* SHA256SUM:

Changes since RPM 4.20.1:

### Overview
* RPM defaults to enforcing signature checking
  ([#1573](https://github.com/rpm-software-management/rpm/issues/1573))
* RPM uses the full key ID or fingerprint to identify OpenPGP keys everywhere
  ([#2403](https://github.com/rpm-software-management/rpm/issues/2403))
* Support for multiple OpenPGP signatures per package
  ([#3385](https://github.com/rpm-software-management/rpm/issues/3385))
* Support for both RPM v4 and v6 packages
* Support for installing RPM v3 packages has been removed
  ([#1107](https://github.com/rpm-software-management/rpm/issues/1107))
* By default, RPM no longer verifies obsolete crypto (MD5, SHA1, DSA)
  ([#1292](https://github.com/rpm-software-management/rpm/issues/1292))
* Man page overhaul (work in progress as of 6.0 alpha):
  * Update all manual pages to a new consistent style
    ([#3669](https://github.com/rpm-software-management/rpm/issues/3669))
  * Add man pages for all major components and file formats
    ([#3612](https://github.com/rpm-software-management/rpm/issues/3612))
  * Move end-user commands to section 1
  * Many previously undocumented things covered, many errors fixed
* Pristine and verifiable release tarballs ([#3565](https://github.com/rpm-software-management/rpm/issues/3565)) ([#2702](https://github.com/rpm-software-management/rpm/issues/2702))

### General Use
* Several enhancements to `rpmkeys`(8):
  * `rpmkeys --import` can now be used to update keys.
    ([#2577](https://github.com/rpm-software-management/rpm/issues/2577))
    This also updates the key handle from a short ambiguous key id to
    full fingerprint.
  * `rpmkeys --export` added for exporting keys
  * `rpmkeys --checksig`, `--list`, `--delete` use and expect full
    fingerprint of the keys
    ([#3360](https://github.com/rpm-software-management/rpm/issues/3360))
  * `rpmkeys` works identically with all keystore backends
  * `rpmkeys --rebuild` can be used to rebuild the keystore contents and
     moving between different keystore backends ([#3347](https://github.com/rpm-software-management/rpm/issues/3347))
* Several enhancements to `rpmsign`(1):
  * `rpmsign` can use either GnuPG or Sequoia-sq for signing (controlled
    by `%_openpgp_sign` macro (`gpg` or `sq`)
  * `rpmsign --addsign` always adds a new signature (arbitrary number of
    signatures supported now)
  * `rpmsign --resign` replaces all existing signatures with a new one
* New query tag extensions (eg with `--qf <format>`):
  * `rpmformat` for determining package format version (3/4/6)
  * `openpgp` for managing all supported OpenPGP signature types
* New `--filemime` query alias for querying per-file MIME info
* `--pkgid` and `--hdrid` query sources cli-switches have been dropped
  ([#2633](https://github.com/rpm-software-management/rpm/issues/2633))
* Consistent terminology and case usage in signature and key messages
  * OpenPGP signatures are called OpenPGP in output
  * RPM v3 header+payload signatures are called "legacy" in output

### Packaging
* `rpmbuild` now supports generating two different package formats
  (controlled by `%_rpmformat` macro):
  * [RPM v6](https://rpm-software-management.github.io/rpm/manual/format_v6.html)
    * All file sizes and related limits are 64bit
    * Crypto modernization
    * MIME file info
    * Widely compatible with RPM >= 4.14
  * [RPM v4](https://rpm-software-management.github.io/rpm/manual/format_v4.html)
    * Bit-per-bit compatible with packages produced by RPM 4.x
* `rpmbuild` can now automatically sign packages if `%_openpgp_autosign_id`
  macro is defined ([#2678](https://github.com/rpm-software-management/rpm/issues/2678))
* New command `rpm-setup-autosign` added for easy auto-signing configuration
  ([#3522](https://github.com/rpm-software-management/rpm/issues/3522))
* New `%{span:...}` macro to make defining multi-line macros nicer
* New `%{xdg:...}` macro for evaluating XDG base directories
* Fix architecture checking accidentally moved after build
  ([#3569](https://github.com/rpm-software-management/rpm/issues/3569))
* Fix buildsys specific %prep section not accepted
  ([#3635](https://github.com/rpm-software-management/rpm/issues/3635))
* Fix `check-rpaths` brp script when both RPATH and RUNPATH exist ([#3667](https://github.com/rpm-software-management/rpm/issues/3667))
* `brp-elfperms` buildroot policy script was removed ([#3195](https://github.com/rpm-software-management/rpm/issues/3195))

### API Changes
* Several additions to rpmKeyring:
  * rpmKeyringInitIterator(), rpmKeyringIteratorNext(),
    rpmKeyringIteratorFree() for iterating over keyring contents
  * rpmKeyringVerifySig2()
  * rpmKeyringModify() for ... XXX we don't need it anymore in the API?
* Several additions to rpmPubkey:
  * rpmPubkeyFingperint(), rpmPubkeyFingerprintAsHex(),
    rpmPubkeyKeyIDAsHex() and rpmPubkeyArmorWrap() accessors
* rpmtxnDeletePubkey() for deleting pubkey's from transaction keystore

### Internal Improvements
* RPM is now built as C++20 code (except for plugins and Python bindings)
  * All relevant sources have been renamed to `.cc` or `.hh` extension
  * Many dynamic data structures moved to STL and other similar refactorings
* Numerous improvements to the test-suite
  * Simplify test creation
* Add an actual keystore abstraction
* New openpgp.cert.d based keystore (experimental) ([#3341](https://github.com/rpm-software-management/rpm/issues/3341))
* New `make site` build target for easy local rendering of documentation
* Make reference counting atomic throughout the codebase
* Fix keystore reads lacking transaction lock
* Fix a race condition in rpmioMkpath() ([#3508](https://github.com/rpm-software-management/rpm/issues/3508))
* Fix recursion depth for macro error message ([#3197](https://github.com/rpm-software-management/rpm/issues/3197))
* Fix empty password field in passwd/group causing entry to be ignored
  ([#3594](https://github.com/rpm-software-management/rpm/issues/3594))
* Fix built-in macros not usable before loading macro files ([#3638](https://github.com/rpm-software-management/rpm/issues/3638))
* Drop gpg(keyid) provides from gpg-pubkey headers ([#3360](https://github.com/rpm-software-management/rpm/issues/3360))
* Eliminate various internal symbols accidentally leaking to the ABI
* Optimize rpmlog() locking

### Building RPM
* A C++20 compiler is now required in addition to a C99 compiler, but
  C++20 modules support is not required.
* [scdoc](https://git.sr.ht/~sircmpwn/scdoc) man page generator is now
  required for building rpm
* Pre-built API documentation is no longer shipped in the release tarballs.
  Building it is optional, but [Doxygen](https://github.com/doxygen/)
  is required for doing so. Pre-built API documentation for all releases
  can be found in https://ftp.rpm.org/api/

### Compatibility Notes
#### Package format
* Support for RPM v3 packages has been removed. They can still be queried
  and also unpacked with rpm2cpio.
* RPM v4 packages remain fully supported (but see below for crypto limitations)
* RPM v6 packages
  * Can be queried with rpm >= 4.6
  * Can be unpacked with rpm >= 4.12
  * Can be verified and installed with rpm >= 4.14 (with caveats/limitations)
* In the default configuration, packages built with rpm < 4.14.0 cannot
  be verified due to their use of weak, obsolete MD5 and SHA1 digests.
  For strongly signed packages, this can be worked around by changing
  `%_pkgverify_level` to `signature` so the weak digests are simply ignored.
  If verifying the weak digests is necessary, the rpm 4.x behavior can
  be restored by setting `%_pkgverify_flags` to `0`.
* Lua posix.fork() family of calls, deprecated in 4.20, is disabled in
  packages built with RPM >= 6.0. They continue to function in packages
  built by RPM <= 4.20 however.

#### Other
* Package signing key configuration differs from the past. To support
  other implementations besides GnuPG, the signer ID is now set via
  `%_openpgp_sign_id` macro, which defaults to `%{?_gpg_name}` for
  backwards compatibility.
* The low-level package signing macros are now parametric, any custom
  `%__gpg_sign_cmd` overrides will simply not work as such. Users are
  encouraged to look into dropping such overrides rather than just
  updating, most such overrides haven't been necessary in a long time.
* `%_passwd_path` and `%_group_path` are now treated as colon separated
  paths to allow using multiple files as the source of NSS information
  (eg with nss-altfiles)
