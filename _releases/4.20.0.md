* [Declarative build system](https://rpm-software-management.github.io/rpm/manual/buildsystem.html) support
* [Dynamic spec](https://rpm-software-management.github.io/rpm/manual/dynamic_specs.html) improvements
* Guaranteed, RPM-controlled per-build directory
* Support for [spec-local](https://rpm-software-management.github.io/rpm/manual/dependency_generators.html#using-file-attributes-in-their-own-package) file attributes and generators
* Support for group membership in `sysusers.d(5)` files
* Proper distro-agnostic debuginfo support
* Sanitized spec comments and indentation syntax
* Sanitized `--build-in-place` mode
* New `unshare` plugin for scriptlet isolation
* Plugin API made public

### User Interface
* The `rpmkeys(8)` command learned the `--list` and `--delete` options.

* The `rpmsign(8)` command learned to sign packages with ECDSA keys.

* The `rpm2archive(8)` utility now supports cpio file format, replacing the implementation of `rpm2cpio(8)` which is now installed as a symlink to the former.

* It's now possible to ask `rpm(8)` for JSON-formatted output when doing queries, with the new `--json` option.  This is a more readable alternative to the existing `--xml` option.

* The `${XDG_CONFIG_HOME}/rpm` directory is now the preferred location when loading per-user macro configuration ([#2153](https://github.com/rpm-software-management/rpm/issues/2153)).

* A new `rpm-plugin-unshare(8)` plugin to prevent filesystem and network access in scriptlets by using Linux `namespaces(7)` ([#2632](https://github.com/rpm-software-management/rpm/issues/2632), [#2665](https://github.com/rpm-software-management/rpm/issues/2665)).

### Spec & Package Building
* The new `BuildSystem` directive is now available for declaring which build system is used by the packaged software.  With this directive, the sources will be automatically prepared, compiled and installed according to the given build system's best practices, instead of requiring the packagers to provide the `%prep`, `%build` or `%install` scriptlets themselves.  This reduces boilerplate while still allowing packagers to [tweak](https://rpm-software-management.github.io/rpm/manual/buildsystem.html#spec-usage) these steps if necessary, such as to conform to the distribution's guidelines or preferences.  Build systems can be [registered](https://rpm-software-management.github.io/rpm/manual/buildsystem.html#supporting-new-build-systems) with RPM by defining a collection of macros.  Note that RPM itself will not ship these definitions by itself, this is left to the distributions or build system maintainers.  We provide [examples](https://github.com/rpm-software-management/rpm/blob/master/tests/data/macros.buildsystem) for Autotools and CMake, however, which can be used for inspiration.  For more details on this feature, see the dedicated [page](https://rpm-software-management.github.io/rpm/manual/buildsystem.html).

* Build scriptlets, such as `%build`, `%install` or `%check`, can now be [augmented](https://rpm-software-management.github.io/rpm/manual/spec.html#build-scriptlets) arbitrary number of times by appending or prepending to them with the new `-a` and `-p` options.  This is particularly handy for tweaking specs that use the new `BuildSystem` feature described above.

* Dynamic spec parts may now include directives and sections that don't influence the build process itself.  If those that do influence the build are used, a proper error message is now printed ([#2917](https://github.com/rpm-software-management/rpm/pull/2917)).

* A per-package build directory that's fully RPM-controlled is now used and exposed as the new `%builddir` macro at build time ([#2078](https://github.com/rpm-software-management/rpm/issues/2078)).

* `--build-in-place` now has clearer and less ambiguous semantics.  See the [Compatibility Notes](#compatibility-notes) below as well as the option's updated description in `rpmbuild(8)` for more details.

* `%autosetup` learned the `-C` option that ensures the sources will be extracted in the root of the build directory ([#2664](https://github.com/rpm-software-management/rpm/issues/2664)).

* A warning is now issued if the number range given to `%autopatch` doesn't match any patches.  You can suppress it with the `-q` option ([#3093](https://github.com/rpm-software-management/rpm/issues/3093)).

* Distributions can now override build conditionals (`%bcond`) system-wide with the new `%{bcond_override_default NAME VALUE}` macro.

* File trigger scripts now receive package count arguments, much like regular triggers ([#2755](https://github.com/rpm-software-management/rpm/issues/2755)).

* File attributes and generators can now be shipped by the same package that uses them, as opposed to having to be distributed separately.  For details, see the dedicated [page](https://rpm-software-management.github.io/rpm/manual/dependency_generators.html#using-file-attributes-in-their-own-package) and [#782](https://github.com/rpm-software-management/rpm/issues/782).

* A new multi-file protocol allowing for much faster dependency generation is now available.  See the dedicated [page](https://rpm-software-management.github.io/rpm/manual/dependency_generators.html#writing-dependency-generators) for details.

* `brp-strip` no longer attempts to process Ruby, Python or Javascript files, making it more efficient and faster, especially in the situations where I/O is expensive.

* Better support for reproducible builds.  It's now possible to set a timestamp handling policy with the new macro `%build_mtime_policy`.  Two policies are currently available; one for clamping the timestamps to `$SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH` (which deprecates and replaces the `%clamp_mtime_to_source_date_epoch` macro) and one for clamping them to the build time (this is a new feature).  Set the macro to `clamp_to_source_date_epoch` or `clamp_to_buildtime` to use the respective policy.  Additionally, build time is now exposed to build scriptlets via the new `$RPM_BUILD_TIME` environment variable and can also be overridden manually via the new `%_buildtime` macro.  For more details on these macros, see the dedicated [page](https://rpm-software-management.github.io/rpm/manual/buildprocess.html#reproducability).

* Proper distribution-agnostic debuginfo enablement logic ([#2204](https://github.com/rpm-software-management/rpm/issues/2204)).  Distributions no longer need to override the `%install` section with a macro in order to inject the `%debug_package` boilerplate themselves.  Debuginfo generation is now handled automatically and [properly](https://rpm-software-management.github.io/rpm/manual/dynamic_specs.html), and is enabled on Linux by default.

* Group membership lines are now supported in `sysusers.d(5)` files.

* The Lua API learned a new `rpm.spawn()` function that supersedes `rpm.execute()` and provides more fine-grained control, currently for redirecting stdin, stdout and stderr to given paths ([#3192](https://github.com/rpm-software-management/rpm/issues/3192)).

* Comments (starting with a `#`) after spec conditionals are now legal syntax.  These were originally allowed due to a spec parser bug but in recent versions triggered a build warning ([#829](https://github.com/rpm-software-management/rpm/issues/829)).

* Indentation is now [allowed](https://rpm-software-management.github.io/rpm/manual/spec.html#preamble-tags) for spec tags ([#2927](https://github.com/rpm-software-management/rpm/issues/2927)).

### Bug Fixes
* Regression: Packages with unsupported usage of the `%config` flag (e.g. with directories), such as those made with the Gradle plugin, no longer fail to install ([#2890](https://github.com/rpm-software-management/rpm/issues/2890)).
* Regression: Ensure binary and source headers are identified as such in `rpmspec(8)` queries ([#2819](https://github.com/rpm-software-management/rpm/issues/2819)).
* Regression: Allow for manual debuginfo packaging again (an ancient regression) ([#3057](https://github.com/rpm-software-management/rpm/issues/3057)).
* Regression: Fix dependency generators sometimes dying with `SIGPIPE` ([#2949](https://github.com/rpm-software-management/rpm/issues/2949)).
* Really allow qualifiers like pre/post/meta for weak dependencies ([#624](https://github.com/rpm-software-management/rpm/issues/624)).
* Set git commit dates in `%autosetup -S git` based on `$SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH` ([#9](https://pagure.io/fedora-reproducible-builds/project/issue/9)).
* Issue a warning when passing arguments to non-parametric macros ([#2932](https://github.com/rpm-software-management/rpm/issues/2932)).
* Fix `%quote` macro special characters leaking to the outside.
* Fix `%shescape` macro to escape all arguments.
* Fix `%transfiletriggerpostun` only matching on the first prefix, ignoring the rest ([#3048](https://github.com/rpm-software-management/rpm/issues/3048)).
* Fix multiply defined local macros escaping scope ([#3056](https://github.com/rpm-software-management/rpm/issues/3056)).
* Make `%dirname` and `%basename` behave like `dirname(3)` and `basename(3)` ([#2928](https://github.com/rpm-software-management/rpm/issues/2928)).
* Run build scriptlets with closed stdin to enforce unattended builds.
* Always create `%specpartsdir` on build ([#3063](https://github.com/rpm-software-management/rpm/issues/3063)).
* Let eBPF ELF files be packaged in noarch packages ([#2875](https://github.com/rpm-software-management/rpm/issues/2875)).
* Never use current user info or file ownership during build ([#2604](https://github.com/rpm-software-management/rpm/issues/2604)).
* Ignore non-scriptlet weak dependencies in ordering ([#1346](https://github.com/rpm-software-management/rpm/issues/1346)).
* Automatically load proper platform configuration on `BuildArch` when `--target` is not used ([#3049](https://github.com/rpm-software-management/rpm/issues/3049)).
* Ensure `rpmbuild(8)` cleanup doesn't fail due to permissions ([#2519](https://github.com/rpm-software-management/rpm/issues/2519)).
* Use UTC timezone when uncompressing zip archives for consistency ([#2955](https://github.com/rpm-software-management/rpm/issues/2875)).
* Multiple fixes to archives created by `rpm2archive(8)`.
* Eliminate hardcoded assumptions about `gpg(1)` in error messages ([#3274](https://github.com/rpm-software-management/rpm/issues/3274)).

### Development & Build System
* The plugin API is now public ([#1536](https://github.com/rpm-software-management/rpm/issues/1536)).

* Include dirs are now exported in lib targets as well ([#3222](https://github.com/rpm-software-management/rpm/issues/3222)).

* An `.editorconfig` file is now provided in the repository (see `CONTRIBUTING.md` for details).

* Python API examples are now provided and installed into `${CMAKE_INSTALL_DOCDIR}`.

* A new low-level package dump utility is now available at `/usr/lib/rpm/rpmdump`.  Note that this tool is not meant for end users and is lacking documentation at the moment.

### API Changes
* Added `rpmdsIsSysuser()` for determining sysusers-dependencies.

* Added `rpmPushMacroAux()`, `rpmMacroEntryPriv()`, `rpmMacroBufAppend()`, `rpmMacroBufAppendStr()` and `rpmMacroBufErr()` to support auxiliary macros implemented in C.

* Added `rpmPluginName()`, `rpmPluginOpts()`, `rpmPluginSetData()`, `rpmPluginGetData()` and various type definitions and other symbols to support rpm plugin creation (details in rpmplugin.h).

* Added a new tag format symbol `RPMTD_FORMAT_JSON`.

* Removed several unused type and struct definitions related to the OpenPGP
  standard (details in rpmpgp.h).

### Internal Cleanup
* The `%prep` section is now implemented as a regular build scriptlet, instead of being treated specially by the spec parser.  This fixes [#1870](https://github.com/rpm-software-management/rpm/issues/1870) as well as makes the behavior consistent with the other spec sections.

* The internal OpenPGP parser has been removed.  RPM can now also be built completely without OpenPGP support (i.e. without Sequoia) to allow for easier bootstrapping, see the INSTALL file for details ([#2414](https://github.com/rpm-software-management/rpm/issues/2414)).

* The Python bindings have been ported to the stable Python ABI ([#2345](https://github.com/rpm-software-management/rpm/issues/2345)).

* The Perl dependency generators have been split out of the main repository ([#2873](https://github.com/rpm-software-management/rpm/issues/2873)).

### Compatibility Notes
* The `%patchN` macro syntax (where `N` is a patch number) is now obsolete and will produce a build error.  Use `%patch N` (or for maximum compatibility, `%patch -P N`) instead.

* Since `%prep` is now a regular build scriptlet, `%setup` and `%patch` are now real macros as well, and are therefore expanded even inside comments.  This can lead to unexpected build failures for specs that have these macros commented out but not escaped, for example:

  ```
  #%setup -n foobar
  ```

  This will result in the following error:

  ```
  cd: foobar: No such file or directory
  ```

  To fix this, you must escape the macro properly as documented [here](https://rpm-software-management.github.io/rpm/manual/spec.html#Comments), for example:

  ```
  %dnl %setup -n foobar
  ```

* In order to enable debuginfo generation during package builds, distributions have historically been using a hack that overrides the `%install` section with a macro that injects the `%debug_package` boilerplate into it.  With RPM now gaining native support for debuginfo enablement, this hack is no longer supported (see [#2204](https://github.com/rpm-software-management/rpm/issues/2204) for details).  Distributions carrying such a macro are now kindly asked to remove it.  As an example of what the (now obsoleted) macro might look like, here's a definition shipped by the redhat-rpm-config package in Fedora 40:

  ```
  %install %{?_enable_debug_packages:%{?buildsubdir:%{debug_package}}}\
  %%install\
  %{nil}
  ```

  Note that the `%__debug_package` macro continues to be automatically set to `1` when debuginfo generation is enabled and thus can be relied upon without any changes.

* As a result of the clarified semantics of `--build-in-place`, the `%prep` stage is now skipped entirely in this mode.  This may break existing specs that rely on `%prep` still applying patches or making additional tweaks to the source tree.  To make such specs compatible with RPM 4.20, these post-preparation steps should be moved to the `%conf` or `%build` sections.

* The `%clamp_mtime_to_source_date_epoch` macro is now deprecated in favor of `%build_mtime_policy` set to `clamp_to_source_date_epoch`.

* Non-comment text (i.e. not starting with a `#`) after spec conditionals is now a build error.

* Lua functions `posix.fork()`, `posix.exec()`, `posix.wait()` and `rpm.redirect2null()` are deprecated. Use `rpm.spawn()` or `rpm.execute()` instead.

* Python 3.7 (when enabled) is now the minimum build requirement.
