summary:
    This is another alpha snapshot that addresses a couple of bugs found in the
    first one and adds two new features
---

* Fix faulty interaction between the scriptlet [prepend/append](https://rpm-software-management.github.io/rpm/manual/spec.html#build-scriptlets) options and the `BuildSystem` tag ([#3024](https://github.com/rpm-software-management/rpm/issues/3024)) which affected the users test-driving the new [Declarative buildsystem](https://rpm-software-management.github.io/rpm/manual/buildsystem.html) feature
* Add proper, built-in debuginfo enablement logic ([#2204](https://github.com/rpm-software-management/rpm/issues/2204))
* Add support for a [timestamp handling policy](https://rpm-software-management.github.io/rpm/manual/buildprocess.html#reproducability), exposed via the new `%build_mtime_policy` macro
