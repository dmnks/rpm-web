# Repository of the rpm.org web page

This repository (well, the master branch) is deployed automatically at http://rpm.org. It is linked together with the in-tree documentation of the [RPM repository](https://github.com/rpm-software-management/rpm) that is rendered at https://rpm-software-management.github.io/rpm/.

To check your local changes follow [this article](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/testing-your-github-pages-site-locally-with-jekyll) and render it with Jekyll and the github-pages gem.
