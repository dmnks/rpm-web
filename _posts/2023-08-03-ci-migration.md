title: CI migrated from SemaphoreCI Classic to GitHub Actions
---
* Due to the planned [discontinuation](https://semaphoreci.com/blog/semaphore-classic-deprecation)
  of SemaphoreCI Classic starting in early September 2023, we have moved to
  GitHub Actions for our CI needs
  (see [#2569](https://github.com/rpm-software-management/rpm/issues/2569) for more details).
